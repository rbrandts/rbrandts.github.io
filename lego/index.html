            <h4 class="article-section">Context</h4>
            <p>In the last year of my master’s degree, from fall of 2022, until summer of 2023, I wrote my thesis in collaboration with LEGO House, an indoor experience center in Billund, Denmark. This project was conducted in partnership with a classmate at Aalborg University, with help from our supervisor. LEGO House reached out to us with a research project proposal, studying how a tangible user interface (TUI) could be used to promote learning through play. The basis of this play was an existing card game which challenged children’s and adults’ knowledge of LEGO and world history since LEGO's founding. Our challenge was to explore how transferring the core of this play experience to a TUI would affect it, and what design choices had to be made when making this transition.</p>

            <h4 class="article-section">The Challenge</h4>
            <p></p>
            <h5>Designing for a tangible tabletop</h5>
            <p></p>
            <h5>Capturing engagement</h5>
            <p></p>
            <h5>Considering the context</h5>
            <p></p>
            
            <h4 class="article-section">My Role</h4>
            <h5>Initial exploration</h5>
            <p></p>
            <h5>Ideation</h5>
            <p></p>
            <h5>Designing the experience</h5>
            <p></p>
            <h5>Developing the prototype</h5>
            <p></p>
            <h5>User Studies</h5>
            <p></p>


            <h4 class="article-section">The Results</h4>
            <p>After numerous iterations and three rounds of user studies at LEGO House, the prototype was finalized. The final play experience we named River of Time, to go with the theme of revitalizing a barren river basin through the correct placement of events on the timeline. The core of the experience was the circular activity of grabbing a token, considering and discussing the event tied to it, attempting to place it on the timeline, and either being wrong and rethinking the placement, or being right and grabbing another. Surrounding this core experience was an introductory screen letting players choose a difficulty level and language, a short explanation of the players’ objective in the game, and an end screen summarizing their performance with the possibility of resetting and trying again.</p>

            <p>In this finalized version of the prototype, the one which was used for our third user study, the defining feature was the choice of difficulty; easy or hard. What this choice decided would be the database of possible events that tokens could represent. The harder difficulty would draw from more obscure events, and really challenge the players’ knowledge. The existence of variable difficulty levels let anyone participate. Groups with younger children could find excitement in recognizing events, and finding success through teamwork. Older visitors, or those with an intimate knowledge of LEGO history, had the possibility of challenging themselves, and being faced with difficult discussions and choices.</p>
            <img src="" alt="Two pictures: intro screen, and side-by-side comparison of easy and hard event">
            <p>Another defining feature of River of Time, was the goal of creating a prototype which would fit into the context it was intended for, both thematically, and in fidelity. This meant a focus on theme and polish. Each installation in LEGO House is trying to tell a story, whether that be about expressing emotion, contributing to society, or being creative. The story we wanted to tell was about working together to make the world a better place. Working together was already built into the nature of the play experience, showing how it improved the world was built into our theme.</p>

            <p>In addition to having designed and developed River of Time as a research platform to explore tangible tabletop-based play experiences, this project had three other contributions. Firstly, the empirical data which we collected during our three user studies. Secondly, an open-source toolkit for setting up a design and development environment for the particular tangible tabletop we used. And thirdly, a set of four implications for the design of tangible tabletop-based intergenerational play experiences in a museum context. These are meant to serve as the conclusive findings from the project, and should serve as a guide to future designers working in a similar domain:</p>
            <h5>#1 Adjustable difficulty accommodates wider audiences</h5>
            <p>In a museum context, people of all ages are encouraged to engage with exhibits. Adjustable difficulty allows a wider audience to have a positive and engaging play experience. Additionally, by allowing players to choose their difficulty, we found that players experienced meaningful progression.</p>
            <h5>#2 Encourage collaboration through equal access</h5>
            <p>Presenting the experience with equal access for all players leads to a more engaging experience. This encourages each player to be involved, and take on a role in which they can contribute their competences. By allowing simultaneous interactions to take place across the group, the social dynamics which best fit the group are allowed to manifest.</p>
            <h5>#3 Simple mechanics, clear instructions</h5>
            <p>The hands-on nature of tangible tabletops can be effective at quickly teaching players how to interact. When mechanics are kept simple, and instructions are clear, players are quicker to dive into the core of the experience, where learning through play occurs.</p>
            <h5>#4 Encourage iterative play</h5>
            <p>Repeated playthroughs allow players to learn the experience, iterate on strategic approach, and achieve a sense of progression. We found that players were often excited to play again and motivated to perform even better during a second playthrough.</p>
