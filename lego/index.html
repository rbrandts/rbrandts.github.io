            <h4 class="article-section">The Context</h4>
            <p class="article-text">In the last year of my master’s degree, from fall of 2022, until summer of 2023, I wrote my thesis in collaboration with LEGO House, an indoor experience center in Billund, Denmark. This project was conducted in partnership with a classmate at Aalborg University, with help from our supervisor. LEGO House reached out to us with a research project proposal, studying how a tangible user interface (TUI) could be used to promote learning through play. The basis of this play was an existing card game which challenged children’s and adults’ knowledge of LEGO and world history since LEGO's founding. Our challenge was to explore how transferring the core of this play experience to a TUI would affect it, and what design choices had to be made when making this transition.</p>
